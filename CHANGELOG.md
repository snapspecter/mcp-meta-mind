## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-17

### üöÄ Major: SQLite Database Backend

**ENHANCEMENT**: Implemented SQLite database backend for improved performance, reliability, and scalability.

#### üóÑÔ∏è Database & Storage
- **SQLite Database Backend**: Robust database storage with automatic initialization
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean separation of database operations from business logic
- **Schema Management**: Automatic database initialization and schema creation
- **Enhanced Performance**: Significantly faster task queries and operations
- **Data Integrity**: Improved data consistency and relationship management
- **ACID Transactions**: Data integrity guaranteed with proper transaction management
- **Better Concurrency**: WAL mode SQLite for improved concurrent access
- **Database Indexes**: Optimized query performance with proper indexing

#### üîÑ Architecture Improvements
- **Data Storage**: All data now stored in `~/.meta_mind/tasks.db`
- **Internal Architecture**: Complete refactor using Repository Pattern
- **Memory Usage**: Reduced memory footprint with efficient database operations
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with database constraints

#### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Reliability
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Referential integrity enforced at database level
- **Schema Validation**: Database schema ensures data consistency
- **Automatic Rollback**: Failed operations don't corrupt data
- **Data Persistence**: Reliable data storage across sessions

#### üîß Technical Details
- Uses `better-sqlite3` for high-performance SQLite operations

- Type-safe database operations with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- Comprehensive test coverage for all database operations

#### üìö Documentation
- **Implementation Summary**: Detailed technical implementation overview
- **Updated README**: Enhanced technical documentation and setup instructions
- **Example Workflows**: Real-world usage examples and patterns

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-10

### Added
- **Automatic Task Tree Archiving**: Completed task trees are automatically archived when all descendants are marked as "done"
  - Triggered by `mark_task_done` and `mark_task_failed` operations
  - Preserves all task relationships, metadata, and artifacts
  - Only complete task trees are archived (never individual subtasks)
- New `_autoArchiveTaskTree()` helper method for internal automatic archiving
- Enhanced response objects include `archivedInfo` when automatic archiving occurs
- Comprehensive documentation in `AUTOMATIC_ARCHIVING.md`
- Example workflow documentation in `EXAMPLE_WORKFLOW.md`

### Changed
- `mark_task_done` and `mark_task_failed` responses now include archiving information when applicable
- Package description updated to reflect automatic archiving capability
- README updated with key features section highlighting automatic archiving

### Technical Details
- Auto-archiving preserves backward compatibility - manual `archive_task_tree` tool still works
- No configuration required - feature is enabled by default
- Task trees are only archived when the root task and ALL descendants are "done"
- Failed subtasks don't prevent archiving if parent task completes

## [0.1.0] - 2025-06-10

### Added
- Initial release of Meta Mind MCP Server
- Task planning and management system
- Hierarchical task support with parent-child relationships
- Task dependencies and validation
- Manual task archiving via `archive_task_tree` tool
- Completion summary logging
